There was once on a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to try her. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs. Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, wooers presented themselves. The maid heard some one standing at the house-door, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said,
 
"What may you be about, Miss Cat.?
Do you sleep or do you wake?"
 
She answered, 
"I am not sleeping, I am waking,
Wouldst thou know what I am making?
I am boiling warm beer with butter so nice,
Will the gentleman enter and drink some likewise?"
 
"No, thank you, miss," said the fox, "what is Mrs. Fox doing?" The maid replied, 
"She sits all alone,
And makes her moan,
Weeping her little eyes quite red,
Because old Mr. Fox is dead."
 
"Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her." "Certainly, young sir."
 
The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,
The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,
"Mistress Fox, are you inside?"
"Oh yes, my little cat," she cried.
"A wooer he stands at the door out there."
"Tell me what he is like, my dear?"
 
"But has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr. Fox?" "Oh, no," answered the cat, "he has only one." 
 
"Now open the gates and doors all wide,
And carry old Mr. Fox outside."
